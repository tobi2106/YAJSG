How does 直 display for you?

This is really important for Anki, Yomitan, your browser etc. <br>

#### Reviewing
Check if `直` gets diplayed correctly on the cards while reviewing:
- Click on browse
- Select / create a creade with `直`

If it gets not diplayed correctly, the font is installt incorrectly or not detected. <br>
Please ask for help or see: [TheMoeWay Font Anki](https://learnjapanese.moe/font/#anki). <br>
Maybe you need to force it.

#### Edit fields 
Check if `直` gets diplayed correctly on the edit fields in the note type.
If not, you can change the font for every edit field. <br>
This is not really nessesary but still good to see the kanji displayed correctly on the edit fields. 
- click on `Fields` 
- select a field, where japanese text is supposed to be displayed
- change `Editing Font` to a japanese font:
- e.g. `Noto Sans JP`
