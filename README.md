Yet another japanese setup guide
===

Just another guide to set up your Japanese learning environment. <br>
There are a ton of guides on the internet for the best setups. <br>
For this guide, I used [7 guides in total](setup/UsedGuides.md). <br>

Within this guide, I'll detail my approach to setting up essential tools such as Anki,
Yomitan, and various immersion resources.

These resources encompass:

- Websites
- YouTube
- Netflix
- Manga
- Visual Novels
- Novels
- and every other streaming website


// The guides for the immersion setups are still WIP.

First of all, we need to set up Anki and Yomitan. <br>
Simply follow the steps below: <br>
#### Basic Setup
1. [Are you using a Japanese font?](setup/JapaneseFont.md)
2. [Download Yomitan](setup/Yomitan.md)
3. [Download and set up Anki](setup/AnkiSetup.md)
4. [Get decks for basic vocabulary](setup/AnkiDecks.md)
5. [Set up Animecards for Yomitan and Anki](setup/YomitanAnki.md)

#### Immersion Setups
