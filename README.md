Yet another japanese setup guide OLD Yekyll version
===

Just another guide to set up your Japanese learning environment. <br>
There are a ton of guides on the internet for the best setups. <br>
For this guide, I used [7 guides in total](). <br>

Within this guide, I'll detail my approach to setting up essential tools such as Anki, 
Yomitan, and various immersion resources. <br>
These resources encompass: <br>
- Websites
- YouTube
- Netflix
- Manga
- Visual Novels
- Novels
- and every other streaming website 

// The guides for the immersion setups are still WIP.
