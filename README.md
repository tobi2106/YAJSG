Yet another japanese setup guide
===

Just another guide to set up your Japanese learning environment. <br>
There are a ton of guides on the internet for the best setups. <br>
For this guide, I used 7 guides in total. <br>

For this guide, I wrote down how I set up Anki, Yomitan, and all immersion methods you could possibly use. <br>
This includes: <br>
- Websites
- YouTube
- Netflix
- Manga
- Visual Novels
- Novels
- and every other streaming website 

// The guides for the immersion setups are still WIP.

First of all, we need to set up Anki and Yomitan. <br>
