Animecards
===

I used the setup guide from [JP Mining Note](https://arbyste.github.io/jp-mining-note/setup/) <br>

We are using the `jp mining note` or more commently known as `Anime cards`.

### Installing

The same steps are also found in the guide. <br>
Download the Note Type: <br>
- Go to the [release page](https://github.com/arbyste/jp-mining-note/releases)
- Download `{version}-jpmn_example_cards.apkg`

Import the Note Type to Anki: <br>
- Open Anki
- Go to `File`
- `Import...` the `jpmn_example_cards.apkg`

Download the custom fonts: <br>
- Download the 4 `.otf` files from the `media folder`
- Click on the `.otf` file
- Click on the download button at the top right

Import the custom fonts to Anki: <br>
- Press `WinKey` + `r`
- Enter `%Appdata%`
- Navigate to `Anki2/YOUR_PROFILE_NAME/collections.media`
- Move the 4 `.otf` files into the `media folder`

#### Verfying the Note Type

See [JP Mining Note](https://arbyste.github.io/jp-mining-note/setup/)

You sould see a new deck `JPMN-Examples` in your collection. <br>
- Go to `Browse`
- Select `JPMN-Examples`
- Press `Preview`

View one of the cards an mkare sure, the card looks similar to the one in the pictures below: <br>

<img src="images/Verifying_JP_Note_Type_light.png" width="350"/> <br>
<img src="images/Verifying_JP_Note_Type_dark.png" width="350"/> <br>

(The following list is a one to one copy from the Setup Page from [JP Mining Note](https://arbyste.github.io/jp-mining-note/setup/))

1. The fonts should match with the above example. <br>If the fonts don't match, try restarting Anki. <br>If the fonts still don't match, the note was likely installed with "Option 2: The Manual Way". <br>Please verify you manually installed the fonts and placed them in the correct folder (see steps 3 and 4).

2. Notice how at the top left corner, the info circle (the "i" encased within the circle) is the default grey color. <br>If this circle is red or orange, there may be something wrong with the template. Please see this section for basic troubleshooting.

3. Clicking on the image to zoom should work out of the box. <br> Kanji hover may not work yet. If it doesn't work, read the Anki-Connect setup instructions on the next page. <br>If the image suddenly appears without a zoom animation, then you must [enable animations on Anki](https://arbyste.github.io/jp-mining-note/setupanki/#enable-animations-2161-2163).

4. If the furigana on your card seems to appear higher above the kanji compared to the picture, see the [Fix Ruby Positioning](https://arbyste.github.io/jp-mining-note/uicustomization/#fix-ruby-positioning-for-legacy-anki-versions) option.

5. If the frequency list on the top right appears to be squished (with no spacing between the elements) see the FAQ on [fixing the frequency list display](https://arbyste.github.io/jp-mining-note/faq/#the-frequency-list-display-looks-squished).
