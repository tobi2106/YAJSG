Anki
===

I used the setup guide from [xelieu - the lazy guide](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setupAnki/)  
And the guide from [donkuri - Immersion-Based Japanese Learning](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/setup/#installing-anki)

#### Download Anki

Download [Anki 32.12.1 Qt6](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

<summary>Creating an account</summary>

You technically don't need a Anki account. <br>
The account is only for syncing and backuping your decks and data. <br>
If you click on sinc, Anki will check your current data with the data storet on [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/about)

<summary>Setting up Anki</summary>

note: <br>
If you used anki a lot before and you like the v2 schedular, you don't need to change to FSRS. <br>
FSRS is a new algorithm for scheduling reviews. It's highly recommented to use the new scheduler <br>
[but don't forget to do a backup of your deck, just in case].

Go to: <br>
- Tools
- Preferences
- Review
- Delete `Answer keys` for `Hard` and `Easy`
- Make sure `Past clipboard images as PNG` is **not** checked

Click on the `⚙` next to a deck
- click on `option`
- scroll to the bottom and enable FSRS
- apply the following options from the pictures

<img src="images/deck_options_1.png" width="300"/> <br>

<summary>Anki Add-ons</summary>

#### Why do I need Add-ons?
If you want to mine vocabularies, it takes a good amount of time to create a new card. <br>
You would need to configure a note type for Anki, defining fields, and the font and back template, and the style for the note type. <br>
After that, you can add cards to your deck, but you need to do this manually. <br>
With add-ons, you can automate the process of adding a new card to Anki. <br>

note: <br>
Please read the description for [AJT Mortician](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1255924302) on the add-on page. <br>
You don't need to install the [Local Audio Server for Yomichan](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1045800357). 
It only speeds up the process of getting the audio for a word. <br>
