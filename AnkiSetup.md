Anki
===

I used the setup guide from [xelieu - the lazy guide](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setupAnki/)  
And the guide from [donkuri - Immersion-Based Japanese Learning](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/setup/#installing-anki).

#### Download Anki

Download [Anki 32.12.1 Qt6](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

<details>
<summary>Creating an account</summary>

You technically don't need an Anki account. <br>
The account is only for syncing and backing up your decks and data. <br>

Simply click on `sync` and Anki will check your current data with the data stored on [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/about). <br>
If you are not logged in, Anki will ask you to sign in or create a new account. <br>
You can find your account under:
- `Tools`
- `Preferences`
- `Syncing`

<summary>Setting up Anki</summary>

**Note:** <br>
If you used Anki a lot in the past and you like the v2 scheduler, you don't need to change to FSRS. <br>
FSRS is a new algorithm for scheduling reviews. It's highly recommended to use the new scheduler <br>
[but don't forget to do a backup of your deck, just in case].

First of all, we delete the shortcut for the `hard` and `easy` buttons. <br>
It's best to not use the hard and easy buttons, see [FSRS4Anki Q8](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md#faq). <br>
"In fact, FSRS is actually more accurate for people who rarely use "Hard" and "Easy" than for people who use all 4 buttons a lot" <br>
If you don't use FSRS, it's still better to not use the `hard` and `easy` buttons, because you could end up in the so-called [Ease Hell](https://readbroca.com/anki/ease-hell/).

Go to: <br>
- `Tools`
- `Preferences`
- `Review`
- Delete `Answer keys` for `Hard` and `Easy`
- Make sure `Paste clipboard images as PNG` is **not** checked

Click on the `âš™` next to a deck
- click on `option`
- scroll to the bottom and enable `FSRS`
- apply the following options from the pictures

<img src="images/deck_options_1.png" width="350"/> <br>
<img src="images/deck_options_2.png" width="350"/> <br>
<img src="images/deck_options_3.png" width="350"/> <br>

#### Change settings to your liking

If you are writing Kanji down while reviewing, <br>
you should adjust some parameters. <br>
This depends on how long you need to write down the kanji <br> 
and then reviewing it: <br>
- `Learning steps`: e.g., 2m 5m 1h
- `Maximum answer seconds`: e.g., 120

You may also change the display order:
- `New/review order`
- `Interday learning/review order`

<summary>Anki Add-ons</summary>

#### Why do I need Add-ons?
If you want to mine vocabularies, it takes a good amount of time to create a new card. <br>
You would need to configure a note type for Anki, defining fields, and the font and back template, and the style for the note type. <br>
After that, you can add cards to your deck, but you need to do this manually. <br>
With add-ons, you can automate the process of adding a new card to Anki. <br>

**Note:** <br>
If you plan to use AJT Mortician, please read the description for [AJT Mortician](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1255924302) on the add-on page. <br>
You don't need to install the [Local Audio Server for Yomichan](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1045800357). 
It only speeds up the process of getting the audio for a word. <br>
