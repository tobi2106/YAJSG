I used the setup guide from [Immersion-Based Japanese Learning](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/setup/#yomitan-setup) <br>
You can also use the tutorial from [The Moe Way](https://learnjapanese.moe/yomichan/#what-is-yomitan).

Yomitan is a dictionary and supports complete automated card creation with Anki. <br>
We need it to create cards automatically while immersing.

# Adding Dictionaries

For Yomitan to work, you must first install some dictionaries. <br>
There are a **ton** of dictionaries, but for the start, download the dictionaries from my [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/pssuudouaffzeqlzvf95k/h?rlkey=ms8jidg4v8n75rq3muhep5x70&dl=0). 

After downloading, only extract the `dictionary.zip`. 

Installation:

- Go to the Yomitan settings
- Go to Dictionaries
- Click on `Config installed and enabled dictionaries`
- Click on `Import`
- Select all zips from the `dictionary.zip`

This import may take a while. <br>
Feel free to continue with the [Anki download and Setup](AnkiSetup.md).
